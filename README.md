# PrivateWebBrowser
this app is my take on a simple but needed browser without needing alot of features

ive made a distro to showcase the example but to compile you need pyinstaller and in the project in the terminal of pycharm run
{pyinstaller --icon=logo.ico main.py}

it will install everything plus logo
